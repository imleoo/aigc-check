I've been thinking about artificial intelligence lately, and honestly, I'm not entirely sure what to make of it all.

Last week, I tried out one of those AI chatbots everyone's been talking about. It was pretty cool, I guess, though sometimes the responses felt a bit... robotic? Hard to explain, really.

My friend Sarah disagrees with me on this. She thinks AI is going to change everything in the next decade or so. Maybe she's right, but I've seen too many hyped technologies fizzle out to be completely convinced.

The thing that struck me most was how the AI handled ambiguity. When I asked vague questions, it would sometimes give these overly confident answers that turned out to be wrong. That made me a bit nervous, to be honest.

I don't know. I think AI has potential, but I also think we need to be careful about how much we rely on it. Just my two cents, anyway.

What do you all think? Am I being too skeptical here?
